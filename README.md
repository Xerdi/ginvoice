## Versioning

The version of this project uses 3 number positions separated by dots.
Optionally it'll have a post fix with the number of commits after tag leading with a short hash of the commit.

For example:
 - 0.0.1
 - 0.0.1-11-g8fdd034
 
So the second example is eleven commits ahead of the version with a short hash of `g8fdd034`.
